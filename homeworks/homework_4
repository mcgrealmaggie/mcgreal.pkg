# Homework Four: Due Sept. 23  at 5 pm.

First, download your homework. In your RStudio, fill in the below command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiologicalDataAnalysis2019/2022/main/vignettes/homework_4.Rmd", destfile = "")

```

# Question One:

Take a look at [this](https://github.com/ropensci/treedata.table) package. Reading the documentation, what is the primary goal of this package? 

```
#The main goal of the package is to increase the speed and efficiency of phylogenetic data processing by allowing for rapid indexing and simultaneous processing and manipulation of phylogenetic trees and data.
```

# Question Two

Where in this package is the actual code stored? How do you know?

```
#The actual code is stored in the documentation found within the R folder. Each R file, when opened, contains a detailed description of the purpose of its function, how it operates, and the code for the functions themselves.

```

# Question 3

When you look into the code, are you able to understand any of it? What is one thing the authors could do to make the code more understandable?

```
I am able to understand some of it, mainly the "function" function we learned this week, its general format, and some of the arguments included. I can also understand what it is that may be returned, or the output, of the function once applied. I think each R document could have broken up the explanations/instructions by separating the chunks of text and writing them after each line of code so that I can follow along with each step in the process, fuclly understanding the code, what it's doing, how to use it, and why.
```

# Question 4

What are the other directories in the package? What do they contain?

```
I am not sure I am interpreting the meaning of "directories" correctly, however, there are also folders for "data", "docs", "test", etc. These contain an example dataset that can be used to test the package, resources, articles, and other supporting material and documentations about the package itself. 

```

# Question 5

Do you trust that this package does what it says it is doing? Why or why not? 

```
Yes, I trust that this package does what it says it is doing because I looked at the example file using real data, and can see and also better understand the workflow and outputs of the functions within the package, and they align with the original package intentions. 
```

# Question 6

Have a look at [these](https://libguides.bc.edu/dataplan/best_practices) data storage best practices from Boston College. Have this read by Sept. 27 as we will use this in an activity.

## Master's Students

Find a package that does something you'd like to do for your dissertation. Apply the steps above to this package to evaluate its reliability.

#I would like to use the ggmap package for my dissertation
#The primary goal of this package is to retrieve raster map files from online sources to be plotted using ggplot2
#The code is stored in the files within the R directory on the GitHub page. 
#When I look at the code, I am able to understand just about the same amount I was able to understand from the treedata.table package. Mainly the structure and intended outputs of the functions created using the "function" function. 
#Other directories include "data" which contains example datasets of variables and values to be plotted on the retrieved maps, "inst" which contains the appropriate citation for the package (which will be useful if mentioned in my thesis), and "tools" which includes images of outputs using different map bases (=the tools) that can be used with this package. 
#Yes, I trust that this package does what it says it is doing because the input variables and return statements in the code, the map tools given, and the example outputs which combine the retrieved maps with sample data using ggplot2 all align with the intended outcome and use of the package.

#AMW: We've historically used another R package for mapping (leaflet), but maybe we'll switch over. It's nice that this is all in R, whereas our previous package had some external dependencies
