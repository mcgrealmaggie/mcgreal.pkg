### Functions enable repeatability

* How many of you have done something so far in the semester, and then forgotten it later? Let's discuss how to make code more permenant, reusable and readable
    * Informative variable names
    * Consistent indentation and line spacing
    * Good commenting
    * Functions
* Write reusable code.
    * Concise and modular script
    * Functions with general structure 

### Understandable chunks

* Human brain can only hold ~7 things in memory at a given time.
    * Write programs that don't require remembering more than ~7 things at once.
* What do you know about how `sum(1:5)` works internally?
    * Nothing.
    * What do you think it does?
    * Test your idea. Were you right? 
* All functions should work as a single conceptual chunk, labeled in a logical way so that you don't have to remember what it does.

### Reuse

* Want to do the same thing repeatedly?
    * Inefficient & error prone to copy code
    * Even worse to rewrite it every time!
    * If it occurs in more than one place, it will eventually be wrong somewhere.
* Functions are written to be reusable.

### Function basics

```
function_name <- function(inputs) {
  output_value <- do_something(inputs)
  return(output_value)
}
```

```
calc_shrub_vol <- function(length, width, height) {
  volume <- length * width * height
  return(volume)
}
```

* Creating a function doesn't run it.
* Call the function with some arguments.

```
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 1.6, 2.0)
shrub_vol <- calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 1.6, 2.0)
```

* Walk through function execution (using debugger)
    * Call function
	* Assign 0.8 to length, 1.6 to width, and 2.0 to height inside function
	* Calculate volume
	* Send the volume back as output
	* Store it in `shrub_vol`

* Treat functions like a black box.
    * Can't access a variable that was created in a function
        * `> width`
        * `Error: object 'width' not found`
    * 'Global' variables can influence function, but should not.
        * Very confusing and error prone to use a variable that isn't passed in
          as an argument

## Exercise:
> Type the name of a function that we have already used in  class to view the source code of the function. Can you tell what the expected inputs and outputs of the function are?



### Default arguments

* Defaults can be set for common inputs.

```
calc_shrub_vol <- function(length = 1, width = 1, height = 1) {
  volume <- length * width * height
  return(volume)
}

calc_shrub_vol()
calc_shrub_vol(width = 2)
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 1.6, 2.0)
calc_shrub_vol(height = 2.0, length = 0.8, width = 1.6)
```

### Named vs unnamed arguments

* When to use or not use argument names

```
calc_shrub_vol(height = 2.0, length = 0.8, width = 1.6)
```

Or

```
calc_shrub_vol(2.0, 0.8, 1.6)
```

* You can always use names
    * Value gets assigned to variable of that name
    * Remember the 7 things we can hold in memory?
* If not using names then order determines naming
    * First value is `height`, second value is `length`...
    * If order is hard to remember use names
* In many cases there are *a lot* of optional arguments
    * Convention to always name optional argument


### Combining Functions

* Each function should be single conceptual chunk of code
* Functions can be combined to do larger tasks in two ways

* Calling multiple functions in a row

```
est_shrub_mass <- function(volume){
  mass <- 2.65 * volume^0.9
}

shrub_mass <- est_shrub_mass(calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 1.6, 2.0))

library(dplyr)
shrub_mass <- calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 1.6, 2.0) %>%
  est_shrub_mass()
```

* Calling functions from inside other functions
* Allows organizing function calls into logical groups

```
est_shrub_mass_dim <- function(length, width, height){
  volume = calc_shrub_vol(length, width, height)
  mass <- est_shrub_mass(volume)
  return(mass)
}

est_shrub_mass_dim(0.8, 1.6, 2.0)
```

## Consistency 

We ran into some trouble Tuesday. I had defined each of my functions a couple times. And in so doing, I ended up with extra arguments to some functions and none to others.


```{r}

calc_vol <- function(len = 1, width = 10, height = 1){
volume <- len * width * height
return(volume)
}


calc_mass <- function(vol){
mass <- 2.65 * vol^.9
return(mass)
}

calc_den <- function(len, width, height){
vol <-  calc_vol(len, width, height)
mass <- calc_mass(len)
density <- mass/vol
return(density)
}

calc_den(len = 2, width = 3, height = 4 )

```

## Testing

+ How can we know what we've done is good? 
+ How could you verify that a number is right?
  + What about our density? What must be true of it? 
  + Generic vs. specific
+ What about non-numerics?
  + Write some function to clean data.

## Functions from class

```{r}

calc_density <- function(length, width, height){
  volume <- calc_vol(length, width, height)
  mass <- calc_mass(volume)
  density <- mass/volume 
  if (density < volume){
      return(density)
  } else {
    print("Density impossibly large! Check your math.")
  }
}

calc_density <- function(length, width, height){
  volume <- calc_vol(length, width, height)
  mass <- calc_mass(volume)
  density <- mass/volume 
  density <- round(density, 3)
  if (is.double(density)){
    return(density)
  } else {
    print("Density impossibly large! Check your math.")
  }
}

data_cleaning <- function(filepath){
  data_raw <- read_csv(filepath)
  data_clean <- data_raw %>% 
    drop_na()
  if (sum(is.na(d_c)) == 0){
    return(data_clean)
  } else {
    print("NAs still present!")
  }
} 
```
